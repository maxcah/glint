# Glint: Instant Note to Obsidian

## Overview
Glint allows for instant notetaking and export to Obsidian vaults in markdown format, solving the age-old problem of not wanting to open/alt + tab to your notetaking software of choice.

## Install & Usage
Download the program and edit OBSIDIAN_PATH in config.ini to your Obsidian vault (or vault folder) directory, then simply run main.py.
The default keybinds are as follows:\
F1 - Open a note\
Esc - Close note (saves note if note is non-empty)\
Ctrl + Q - Exit the program (note must be currently open)
